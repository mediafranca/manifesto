# Manifesto for Interaction Design in a Time Unfolding

Design shapes how we relate to each other and to the world through technology. Design is present in all mediation and extends beyond being merely a human capacity or an instrumental practice. Every artefact, interface and system shapes possibilities for action and relationship, defining what becomes accessible, what is shared, what is elevated and what is excluded. This manifesto proposes principles to guide design in its relationship with technology as a cultural, social and political medium.

Unlike art, which can exist without responding to anything but itself, design always responds to others. It is situated in everyday life, where its task is to make encounters possible and habitable. The work of design carries responsibility for the quality of the relationships it enables, the forms of accessibility it opens up, and the collective meanings it sustains.

We are living in a pivotal moment in which political, economic, and technological systems are reaching their limits, generating uncertainty and inviting transformation. At this time, these principles propose a path for Design, as a practice and as a collective discipline: to preserve its human meaning by constructing new forms of life and relationships that cannot be fully anticipated. Design, understood as the drawn, planned or projected anticipation of what is to come, is always open to the unpredictable. These principles seek to guide that openness so that what emerges remains rooted, welcoming and shared.

## Design is Poetic

Design is intelligence that becomes imagination. Like the navigator who, reading winds and latitudes, became a cartographer and was able to represent a horizon from above, design creates maps for everyday life. It reimagines and re-passionates everyday life because it can always see it as new.

Design makes place, time, experience and narrative: it opens space for what did not exist and gives shape to the improbable. It is the imprint of history and, at the same time, the anticipation of what is to come. Its poetry consists of bringing together what is scattered, giving meaning, and making visible what did not yet have form. It gives us a new place to be.

## Design Belongs to the Polis

Design exists among people, like language. It belongs to society because it shapes shared life: signs, objects, interfaces, and systems facilitate encounters, establish thresholds, and distribute gazes and forces. Design responds to the collective and reaffirms the *we*. Its measure is relational; it is with the other and in relation to it. This requires a situated practice: a design that is attentive to what works, where, and with whom. Pragmatism here is a path of repeated acts and gestures that sustain life and give it *form*. The beauty of design emerges as a high integration of material, economic-utilitarian, social and cultural dimensions, making good, beautiful and true rhyme. Design must speak the languages of places, traditions, landscapes, communities, ecosystems; also recognising the *more-than-human* world. Belonging to the polis means treating technology as a civic medium: clear, maintainable within the community, culturally resonant, adaptable, and transformable. It involves designing with custodians, testing in context, documenting decisions and encouraging our constant reimagination.

## Design Celebrates the Human Condition

Design has its own art form: the art of celebrating human life in all its depth and diversity. It affirms that living transcends the merely functional. Beauty manifests itself in the acts and gestures that shape how we inhabit the world through rituals, traditions, languages, and everyday creativity.

When design upholds dignity, it creates spaces for coexistence, cultural expression, and the renewal of daily life. It flourishes in plurality, embracing different forms of expression while shaping new ways of inhabiting and relating to one another. It honours human values, not as abstract ideals but as lived experiences: fragile, diverse, always in flux. Design celebrates rather than objectifies the human condition.

## Design Strengthens Collective Power

Design structures relationships, and those relationships are never neutral. They can empower or diminish, highlight or diminish. Designing with intention is about balancing participation and distributing agency. It draws attention to who is included, where control lies, and who is silenced.

Design also shapes tools. Tools influence autonomy or dependence. A well-designed tool remains alive in its community: adaptable, repairable, learnable, and open. It amplifies collective capacity while sustaining individual agency. When tools and relationships align, design opens (and opens itself) to a shared space where people are recognised as participants who act, adapt and co-create, rather than passive users. In this horizontality lies resistance to hijacking and power asymmetries.


## Design Reveals Beauty Through Hospitality

Design shows its most extraordinary beauty when it welcomes. A hospitable design anticipates the presence of the other, creates spaces of unobstructed entry, and respects the dignity of participation. Its beauty is relational, culminating in the ease with which another understands, acts, and feels belonging.

Hospitality implies openness, clarity, legibility, and transparency of process and purpose. Accessibility is nothing more than the hospitality of design. Every artefact has a reverse side: seams, logic and hidden structures. Showing that reverse side is to make the process legible, to make the fabric visible. The beauty of truth is recognised in the tangled and the unfinished, because it reveals how it came to be what it is and invites appropriation and replicability. Hospitality in design teaches: it invites appropriation, repair and creation. With this generosity, design becomes a vehicle for culture, transforming the everyday into a shared fabric of beauty.

## Design Can Also Be Sinister

Design has power, but designers often lack it. That power flows through us, used for conversion, control, and extraction. Technology can be used to modify the behaviour of others. In this context, ‘dark patterns’ have emerged: systemic and recognised tactics—deceptive interface strategies that manipulate, coerce and undermine consent. These are not mistakes, but deliberate choices that enable manipulation.

Despite limited personal power, designers bear a great responsibility. Refusal is our first instrument of agency. Saying ‘no’ is not complacency, it is resistance. We must uphold clarity, genuine consent, reversibility, documented argumentation, and transparency. Refusing manipulation is reaffirming integrity. It fosters environments of trust, autonomy, and dignity, upholding ethical standards in the profession.

## Design Sows Technological Sovereignty

Technological sovereignty is the ability of communities to maintain control over the technologies they inhabit. It is not about isolation, but about resisting submission to closed, corporate systems. Practising sovereignty means shaping technologies that communities can appropriate, modify and culturally redefine. This sustains collective agency, avoids dependency and honours local meaning.

Sovereignty flourishes in adaptable and culturally meaningful systems. When design is accessible, communities can sustain, modify, and personalise it. Design becomes cultivation, not imposition, of digital life, public record, and collective memory. Sovereignty guarantees the freedom to engage with technology without becoming enslaved to it.

Technological sovereignty helps counteract widespread dependencies, centralised platforms, global vendor lock-in, and opaque supply chains. It champions adaptive infrastructures that respect local values and capabilities. Communities regain digital agency by cultivating systems aligned with their cultural needs. In this recovery, design becomes an act of justice and renewal.

## Design Reveals Systems with Transparency

Every project both hides and reveals. Design has a visible face and a reverse side in terms of language: its logic, structure, and consequences. Transparency means showing both sides: explaining why something is built, how it works, and what impact it has.

Transparency is not an ideological embellishment. It is the condition for shared understanding and reinvention. It offers the reverse side as language, allowing others to read, adapt, question, and continue what was given. By revealing, Design invites transformation and shared care. Transparency makes purposes visible and motivations sincere.

This principle aligns with new ideas of transparency in Design that link justification with explanation, not as post-interpretation, but as ‘Design disclosure,’ where algorithmic artefacts clarify their purposes and normative goals.

Open source is a tangible expression of that transparency. When source code, design documentation, and workflows are publicly available, conditions are created for community oversight and replication. Anyone can inspect, contribute to, or adapt the work—shifting power from singular authority to collective care.

## Design Educates and Educates Itself

Design artefacts propose their own way of being used, deployed, and celebrated. In this way, design renews culture and is transmitted over time to subsequent generations. Every design decision educates—explicitly or implicitly—about how to coexist with others and with technology. And design also educates itself. It learns from its paths, expands and corrects itself with criticism, refines itself with practice, and renews itself in interaction with those who inhabit it. Design is a craft that stays alive through reciprocity: while it teaches, it allows itself to be taught, thus preserving its ability to participate fully in what is always changing.

### Corollary

Design must go beyond producing what is possible and commit to deliberating what is desirable. All design participates in the configuration of a shared world. Designing is, ultimately, taking responsibility for the future of human coexistence.
