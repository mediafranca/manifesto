# Design Manifesto

Design is neither solely a transversal human capacity nor simply an instrumental practice; it shapes the ways in which we inhabit the world with technology. Every artefact, interface, and system configures possibilities for action and relation, defines what becomes accessible, what is shared, and what is excluded. This manifesto sets out principles for guiding design in its relationship with technology as a cultural, social, and political medium.


## Design must be pragmatically grounded

Design is pragmatic because it must respond to what works. Pragmatism is not a theory but a path recognised through repeated gestures that sustain life. To design pragmatically is to observe practices through which existence is maintained and to respond to them. Beauty is not opposed to pragmatism but emerges as its expression: beauty appears when necessity resonates, when what is demanding in its purpose also becomes compelling.

## Design must be semantically clear (and therefore cognitively accessible)

Cognitive accessibility is not a corrective adjustment but a principle that must be incorporated from the very origin of design. To design with accessibility in mind is to shape representations that can be reliably understood across diverse contexts and conditions of perception. This involves segmenting concepts clearly, calibrating levels of abstraction, and managing visual density so that elements remain identifiable. Symbols must be tested for comprehensibility and for their consistency in evoking intended referents. Yet accessibility is not only a matter of clarity; it can itself be conceived as a form of beauty. An aesthetics of accessibility elevates design by demonstrating that inclusiveness, legibility, and cognitive resonance are not secondary virtues but integral qualities of form.

## Design must be culturally situated

Artefacts are never neutral containers of information: they embody histories, values, and cosmologies. Situated design acknowledges the knowledge embedded in local traditions, ancestral practices, and the symbolic textures of place—the iconographies of plants, rituals, landscapes, and oral memory. It also recognises the ‘more-than-human’ world: the land, Gaia, Pachamama, the ecosystems that sustain life. To situate design is to allow technologies to carry the voices of local cultures rather than erasing them under dominant imaginaries. In the case of PictoNet, cultural situatedness means that pictograms must be adaptable living signs, reflecting the visual languages and symbolic repertoires of specific communities rather than universalised abstractions detached from context.

## Design must be hospitable {Manaakitanga / Omotenashi}

Hospitality in design is an ethic of encounter that extends beyond functionality; it is a commitment to inclusion, equity, and respect for difference. To be hospitable is to connect with others, not only by welcoming them but by sustaining trust over time. In the poetic sense of Amereida, hospitality unsettles the host, inviting them to question their certainties. In the Japanese ethos of Omotenashi, it is a gesture of sincerity without hidden agendas, an anticipatory care that responds even to unspoken needs. In the Māori concept of Manaakitanga, it is the extension of dignity, respect, and collective wellbeing, where hosting another strengthens the mana of the whole community. Applied to design, hospitality creates systems that welcome difference, sustain reciprocity, and nurture relational bonds.

## Design must promote autonomy

Technological systems often entrap, addict, or drain human capacities. Autonomy is not supported by interfaces that capture attention through endless scrolling or by platforms that erode existing skills. To promote autonomy is to design systems that extend rather than replace, that strengthen rather than diminish. Convivial technologies amplify capacities, enabling people to recover gestures and perspectives that had become inaccessible, opening horizons rather than narrowing them.

## Design must be convivial

Drawing on Illich’s perspective, conviviality in design requires technologies that do not generate asymmetrical dependencies but expand the scope for collective appropriation. Convivial design supports systems that remain open to inspection, adaptation, and modification by their communities of use. Artefacts should be hackable and transformable, enabling individuals and groups to exercise technological sovereignty. In the case of artificial intelligence, conviviality entails models that can be retrained, adjusted, and extended by their users, fostering symmetric autonomy rather than dependence on external providers. Convivial design distributes the capacity to act rather than concentrating it.

## Design must be transparent in its processes

Transparency is more than the disclosure of mechanisms: it is the condition that enables understanding and transformation. A transparent design reveals the why of things—their purpose and consequence—and also the how—the ways they are constructed, the materials, algorithms, and patterns from which they are made. It offers access to the reverse side of artefacts as a legible language, inviting inspection and critique. Transparency thus provides not only accountability but also the possibility of re-appropriation: systems can be questioned, reinterpreted, and altered by those who engage with them.

## Design must be open and shareable

Openness in design means that knowledge, materials, and outputs circulate as resources for participation rather than commodities for consumption. Sharing redefines the role of the user as a contributor who enlarges the network through their participation. Openness makes every participant an economic actor in the broader sense, sustaining a collective presence. To make something open is to integrate it into a common world. Design should give form to this participation, enabling replication, adaptation, and collective growth.

## Design must be deliberative (and therefore open)

Openness is not merely technical but an orientation towards the future. To design openly is to recognise that every system, pictogram, or interface is a proposal for how we should live together. Closed design limits what is possible within existing boundaries; deliberative design pauses to ask what is desirable, what is just, and what sustains life. Openness requires humility: design must remain revisable, contestable, and shared. To be deliberative is to allow design to become a conversation rather than a decree, distributing authorship and responsibility in shaping collective futures.


### Corollary

Design, in its relationship with technology, must move beyond producing what is possible and engage in deliberation about what is desirable. Every system, every pictogram, every interface participates in shaping a shared world. To design is, ultimately, to assume responsibility for the future of human coexistence.
