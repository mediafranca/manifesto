# Design Manifesto


Design is not only a transversal human capacity nor only an instrumental practice; it shapes the ways in which we inhabit the world with technology. Every artefact, interface, and system configures possibilities for action and relation, defines what becomes accessible, what is shared, and what is excluded. This manifesto sets out principles for guiding design in its relationship with technology as a cultural, social, and political medium.
Principles

## 1. Design must be semantically clear (cognitively accessible)
Cognitive accessibility in design means creating representations whose meaning can be reliably grasped across diverse users and contexts. This requires clear segmentation of concepts, a calibrated gradient of abstraction, and control of visual density so that elements remain perceptually identifiable. Symbols must be tested for comprehensibility and for consistent association with their intended referents, following established standards. Ultimately, semantic clarity emerges when a design not only conveys information explicitly but also sustains recognition, interpretation, and use under real conditions of perception and context.

## 2. Design must be culturally situated
To design culturally situated systems is to recognise that artefacts are never neutral containers of information: they embody histories, values, and cosmologies. Situated design respects the knowledge embedded in local traditions, ancestral practices, and the mysteries of place—the iconographies of plants, rituals, landscapes, and oral memory. It acknowledges not only the 'human other' but also the 'more-than-human' world: the land, Gaia, Pachamama, the ecosystems that sustain life. To situate design is therefore to allow technologies to carry the voice of local cultures and not erase them under the weight of dominant imaginaries. In the case of PictoNet, cultural situatedness means that pictograms must not be universalised abstractions detached from context, but living signs that can be adapted to reflect the visual languages, ethnographic textures, and symbolic repertoires of specific communities.

## 3. Design must be pragmatically grounded
Design is inherently pragmatic because it must remain true to what works. The pragmatic is not a theory but the path that becomes visible because it has been walked; it is the gesture that repeats because it fulfils its purpose. To observe the pragmatic is to recognise the acts through which life sustains itself, and to design in response to them. In this sense, beauty is not opposed to pragmatism but is its final expression: beauty appears when what is necessary also resonates, when what is cruel or harsh in its demands becomes at the same time compelling.

## 4. Design must promote autonomy
Design must resist the tendency of technological systems to entrap, addict, and drain human capacities as if they were vampiric devices feeding on attention. True autonomy is not served by interfaces that capture the will through endless scrolling or by platforms that diminish the skills people already possess. To promote autonomy is to design systems that extend rather than replace, that add to one’s ability to act rather than hollow it out. Convivial technologies amplify existing capacities, enabling people to recover gestures and perspectives that had become inaccessible, opening horizons rather than narrowing them.

## 5. Design must be convivial
Following Illich’s perspective, design should foster technologies that do not generate asymmetrical dependencies but instead expand the capacity for collective appropriation. Convivial design entails systems that remain open to inspection, adaptation, and modification by their communities of use. Artefacts should not be closed objects but hackable and transformable ones, allowing individuals and groups to exercise technological sovereignty. In the case of artificial intelligence, conviviality requires that models can be retrained, adjusted, and extended by those who use them, enabling symmetric autonomy rather than reinforcing dependence on external providers. Convivial technology empowers without enclosing; it distributes the ability to act rather than concentrating it.

## 6. Design must be transparent in its processes
Transparency is not only the obligation to reveal what lies behind a system, but also the condition that makes it possible to reshape it. A transparent design exposes its algorithms, data sources, and generative mechanisms in ways that can be inspected, questioned, and reconfigured by those who engage with it. When processes are opaque, encrypted, or closed, technology becomes like an alien rock: impenetrable, immutable, and detached from the human capacity to interpret and transform. Transparency, by contrast, makes design malleable; it allows systems to be rethought and adapted as contexts change.

## 7. Design must be open and shareable
Openness in design means that knowledge, materials, and outputs do not circulate as commodities restricted to consumption, but as resources that invite participation. To share is to transform the role of the user: you are not only a consumer of systems, but a producer who enlarges the network through your contributions. In this sense, openness makes every participant an economic actor, not in the narrow sense of exchange value but in the broader sense of sustaining collective presence. Availability itself becomes a form of public horizontality: to make something open is to make it part of a common world. Design should not restrict this participation but give it form, enabling replication, adaptation, and collective growth.

## 8. Design must be hospitable {Manaakitanga/Omotenashi}
Hospitality in design is an ethic of encounter that extends beyond mere functionality; it is a commitment to inclusion, equity, and respect for difference. To be hospitable is to connect with the other person, not only by welcoming them but by sustaining trust and rapport that can last over time. In the poetic sense of Amereida, hospitality is an act that unsettles the host, inviting them to question their own certainties. In the Japanese ethos of Omotenashi, it is a gesture of sincerity without hidden agendas, an anticipatory care that responds even to unspoken needs. In the Māori concept of Manaakitanga, it is the active extension of dignity, respect, and collective wellbeing, where to host another is to strengthen the mana of the whole community. Applied to design, hospitality means creating systems that do not isolate or standardise people but welcome them in their difference, enabling bonds of reciprocity. Hospitable design is therefore relational: it listens, anticipates, and sustains.

## 9. Design must be deliberative
Openness is not a technical feature; it is an orientation towards the future. To design openly is to recognise that every system, every pictogram, every interface is not a neutral tool but a proposal about how we should live together. Closed design produces what is possible within the boundaries of what already exists; open design pauses to ask what is desirable, what is just, and what sustains life. Openness requires humility: an awareness that design does not have the last word but must remain revisable, contestable, and shared. To be open is therefore to design artefacts and systems that can be entered into, questioned, and reshaped by those who use them. It is to allow design to be a conversation rather than a decree. In this sense, openness is political and ethical: it distributes authorship and responsibility, making design part of a collective deliberation about the future.

### Corolary
Design, in its relationship with technology, must not be limited to producing what is possible, but must deliberate on what is desirable. Every system, every pictogram, every interface participates in the constitution of a shared world. To design is, ultimately, to assume responsibility for the future of human coexistence.
