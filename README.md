# Manifesto for Interaction Design in a Time Unfolding

Design shapes how we interact with each other and with the world through technology. It exists in every form of mediation and extends beyond a purely human capacity or simple instrumental practice. Every artefact, interface, and system shapes possibilities for action and relationship, defining what becomes accessible, what is shared, elevated, or excluded. This manifesto outlines principles to guide design in its relationship with technology as a cultural, social, and political medium.
Unlike art, which may exist without answering to anything beyond itself, design always responds to others. It is situated in everyday life, where its task is to make encounters possible and habitable. The work of design carries responsibility for the quality of relations it enables, for the forms of accessibility it opens, and for the collective meanings it sustains.

We live in an epochal moment where political, economic, and technological systems are reaching their limits, creating uncertainty and inviting transformation. At this time, these principles propose a path for design as both a practice and a collective discipline: to preserve its human sense by constructing new ways of living and relating that cannot be fully anticipated. Design, as drawn, planned, or projected anticipation of what is to come, is always open to the unforeseeable. These principles intend to orient that openness so that what emerges remains grounded, hospitable, and shared.

## Design Belongs to the Polis

Design exists between people, much like language. It belongs to society because it shapes shared life: interfaces, artefacts, and systems facilitate encounters, establish thresholds of access, and allocate effort and attention. Design is accountable to the collective world. Its measure is hospitality and utility—not artistic authorship. It codes relationships as powerfully as institutions and can open or close futures. This demands grounded practice: a design that attends to what works, where, and with whom. Pragmatism here is a path of repeated gestures that sustain life. 

Beauty arises when necessity aligns with clarity, durability, and kindness. Design must communicate through the languages of place traditions, landscapes, communities, and ecosystems—recognising the more-than-human world. To belong to the polis is to treat technology as a civic medium: clear, community maintainable, culturally resonant, repairable, and adaptable. It involves designing with custodians testing in context, documenting decisions, and fostering community reimagination.

## Design Celebrates the Human Condition

Design has its own art: the art of celebrating human life in its depth and diversity. It affirms that living extends beyond mere function. Beauty manifests through gestures that shape how people inhabit the world via rituals, traditions, languages, and daily creativity. When design upholds dignity, it creates space for coexistence, cultural expression, and the renewal of everyday life. It flourishes in plurality embracing different modes of expression while shaping new ways of dwelling and relating. It honours human values not as abstract ideals but as lived experiences: fragile, diverse, always evolving. Design celebrates—rather than objectifies the human condition.

## Design Strengthens Collective Power

Designing structures involves relationships—and those relationships are never neutral. They can either empower or diminish. To design with intention is to balance participation and distribute agency. It draws attention to who is included, where control lies, and who is silenced. Design also shapes tools. Tools influence autonomy or dependency. A well designed tool remains alive in its community adaptable, repairable, learnable, and open. It amplifies collective capacity while enabling individual agency. When tools and relationships align, design fosters a shared ground where people are seen as participants who act, adapt, and co create, rather than as passive users. In this solidarity lies resistance to capture.

## Design Reveals Beauty through Hospitality

Design reveals its greatest beauty when it welcomes others. A welcoming design anticipates the needs of others, creates entry spaces without barriers, and respects the dignity of participation. Its beauty is relational, culminating in someone else's ease in understanding, acting, and feeling that they belong. Hospitality implies openness, clarity, legibility and transparency of process and purpose. Every artefact has a reverse: its seams, logic, and hidden structure. To show that the reverse is to make the process legible, to make weaving visible. The beauty of truth is visible in the tangled and unfinished, because it unveils how form came to be. Hospitality in design teaches: it invites appropriation, repair, creation. Through this generosity, design becomes a vessel of culture, transforming daily life into a shared fabric of beauty.

## Design Can Be Dark 

Design holds power, but designers often lack it. Power flows through us, utilised for conversion, control, and extraction. In this context, “dark patterns” have emerged: systemic, recognised tactics — deceptive interface strategies that mislead, coerce, and undermine consent. They are not mistakes, but deliberate choices that enable manipulation.
Despite limited institutional power, designers bear responsibility. Refusal is our first instrument of agency. Saying “no” is not compliance with constraints it is resistance. We must uphold clarity, genuine consent, reversibility, documented reasoning, and legibility. Refusing manipulation is a reassertion of integrity. It enacts environments of trust, autonomy, and dignity, resisting extraction through ethical intention.

## Design Seeds Technological Sovereignty

Technological sovereignty is the ability of communities to maintain control over the technologies they use. It is not about isolation but resisting confinement by closed, corporate systems. Practising sovereignty involves shaping technology that communities can appropriate, modify, and culturally redefine. This supports collective agency, avoids dependency, and honours local significance.
Sovereignty flourishes in adaptable, locally meaningful systems. When design is accessible, communities can sustain, modify, and personalise it. Design becomes nurturing rather than imposing digital life. Sovereignty guarantees the freedom to engage with technology without becoming enslaved.
Technological sovereignty helps counter pervasive dependencies on centralised platforms, global vendor lock-in, and obscured supply chains. It embraces adaptive infrastructures that respect local values and capacities. Communities reclaim digital agency, cultivating systems aligned with cultural needs. In this reclaiming, design becomes an act of justice and renewal. 

## Design Reveals Systems Transparently

Every project conceals and reveals at the same time. Design has a visible face and a reverse—its logic, structure, and consequences. Transparency involves speaking both sides: explaining why things are built, how they work, and what their impact is.
Transparency is not an ideological feature. It is the condition of shared comprehension and reinvention. It offers reverse as a language, allowing others to read, adapt, contest, and continue what was given. In revealing, design invites transformation and shared stewardship.
This principle aligns with emerging ideas in design transparency that couple justification with explanation, not as post hoc interpretation, but as “design publicity,” where algorithmic artefacts clarify their purposes and normative goals. 
Open source is a tangible expression of that transparency. When source code, design documentation, and workflows are publicly available, they create conditions for communal oversight and replication. Anyone can inspect, contribute, or adapt the work—shifting power from singular authority toward collective stewardship.

## Design Cultivates Custodianship of the Discipline

Design lacks the guardianship that other professions maintain. Its openness is valuable but also leaves it vulnerable to capture by interests misaligned with public welfare. Custodianship proposes building collective structures: spaces of critique, ethical reflection, and accountability.
Designers must care not only for individual practice, but for the field itself. A design guild grounded in responsibility, care, and criticality protects the ethical horizon of the discipline. It ensures design remains a practice of responsibility to the polis, to lived culture, to the future.

### Corollary

Design must move beyond producing what is possible and engage in deliberation about what is desirable. Every design participates in shaping a shared world. To design is ultimately to assume responsibility for the future of human coexistence.
